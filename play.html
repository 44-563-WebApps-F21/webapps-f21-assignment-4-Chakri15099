    <P>
        
        GWENDOLEN.<br>
        The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one
        else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of
        shame left.<br>
        
        CECILY.<br>
        They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.<br>
        
        GWENDOLEN.<br>
        [After a pause.] They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you
        cough?<br>
        
        CECILY.<br>
        But I haven’t got a cough.<br>
        
        GWENDOLEN.<br>
        They’re looking at us. What effrontery!<br>
        
        CECILY.<br>
        They’re approaching. That’s very forward of them.<br>
        
        GWENDOLEN.<br>
        Let us preserve a dignified silence.<br>
        
        CECILY.<br>
        Certainly. It’s the only thing to do now. [Enter Jack followed by
        Algernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]<br>
        
        GWENDOLEN.<br>
        This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.<br>
        
        CECILY.<br>
        A most distasteful one.<br>
        
    
    </P>
